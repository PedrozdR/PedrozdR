## 🧑🏻‍💻About me
Hi there!
I’m João Pedro, but you can call me Pedro. I have a degree in System Analytics and I work as a software engineer. The technology that I’m using the most nowadays is React-Native, and I’ve been working with it since 2018. I also have a background working with Flutter. My main professional objective is to develop my abilities as a React-Native developer. I always try to find a way to grow every day as a professional, learning new technologies and methods to optimize and speed up the development process of a mobile application.

I am always available for a chat, feel free to message me on [Linkedin][linkedin]

## 🛣️ My Coding Journey

  When I started my first job I didn't have much experience with React-Native and from the beginning, I worked for free and after 3 months they hired me, and together we made a lot of apps, some apps I made alone from scratch and others working on a team. After two years I made one of the biggest decisions in my career, it was to left my comfortable job to work with flutter without any knowledge. With Flutter, I've developed a school management app for more than thirty thousand users and another app for management schools' libraries. After working with flutter, I came back to react-native and worked in one of the biggest banks in Brazil, with more than eight million users. In this job, I worked in some teams, one to implement new features for the bank and the other team was to develop accessible features to People with visual impairment.
